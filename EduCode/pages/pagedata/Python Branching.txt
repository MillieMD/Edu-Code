<p>Python has 3 different "control statements". These allow the program to execute different instructions depending on the state of certain variables. The simplest of these statements is an "if/else" statement, which we will demonstate here, however there are also <a href='activityPage.php?topic=While&lang=P'> while </a> and <ahref='activityPage.php?topic=For&lang=P'> for </a> loops which each allow for different kinds of control.</p>

<p>Below is a simple If/Else statement:</p>

<p>Which outputs the following to the console:</p>

<p> The "if" keyword means the program will evaluates the state of the variable "age" and then will execute one of the two indented code blocks. The symbol ">=" is the Python operator for "more than or equal to", Python supports a range of mathematical and boolean comparision operations, using the operators below: </p>

        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td> Is Equal to: </td>
            <td> == </td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td> Is Less Than: </td>
            <td> < </td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td> Is Less Than or Equal to: </td>
            <td> <= </td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td> Is More Than: </td>
            <td> > </td>
        </tr>
         <tr>
            <td> Is More Than or Equal to: </td>
            <td> >= </td>
        </tr>

<p> You can chain multiple statements together to evaluate multiple statements at once: </p>

<img src = '..\images\IfElse3.png'>

<p> This is achieved through logical operators: AND (which requires both statements to be true), OR (which requires atleast one) and NOT (which returns the reverse).</p>

<p> There are some values which always evaluate to true when used in a control statement, these are: </p>
<ul>
    <li> Any integer other than 0 </li>
    <li> Any string besides "" (empty string) </li>
    <li> Any non-empty container </li>
</ul>


<p> You can chain if statements together by using 'Elif', like in the example below: </p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Ensure your code is indented to tell the compiler it's a seperate section.</li>
    <li>Don't forget the colon on the end of the if, elif, and else statements.</li>
    <li>When evalutating 'equals to' statements remember to use a double equals ('==') </li>

</ul>
