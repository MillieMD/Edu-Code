<p>Some programs will need to repeat segments of code. You should avoid writing the same thing out repeatedly and instead use loops. Here we will explain a while loop which repeats based on the state of a variable (condition based looping), if you need to repeat a set number of times (counter based looping) you should use a <a href = 'activityPage.php?topic=For&lang=P'> for loop </a> </p>

<p>Tips:</p>

<ul>

    <li>Ensure your code is indented to tell the compiler it's a seperate section.</li>
    <li>Don't forget the colon on the end of the evaluation statements.</li>
    <li>If you need a refresher on Python comparison operators, take a look <a href = activityPage.php?topic=Branching&lang=P> here </a></li>

</ul>
