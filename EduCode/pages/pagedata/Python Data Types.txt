<p>Python has four primitive data types. These are 'str' for string/plain text, 'int' for whole numbers, 'float' for decimal place numbers and 'bool' for boolean/true or false values. You do not need to assign a data type when creating a variable, as Python is a dynamically typed language and will make assumptions about what data type is most appropriate for the data given. However sometimes it is necessary to cast variables to be specific data types. </p>
